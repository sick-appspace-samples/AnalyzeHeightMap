## AnalyzeHeightMap

Analyzes and evaluates a heightmap

### Description

Shows how the profile API can be used to calculate whether a scanned object passes some criteria or not.
Therefore the volume of the scanned object is calculated.

### How to Run

This sample may currently be outdated.
Editing the UI might not work properly in the latest version of SICK AppStudio. Use SICK AppStudio version <= 2.4.2 to edit the UI.

Starting this sample is possible either by running the App (F5) or
debugging (F7+F10). Setting breakpoint on the first row inside the 'main'
function allows debugging step-by-step after 'Engine.OnStarted' event.
Results can be seen in the image as well as the point cloud viewer on the DevicePage.
To run this sample a device with SICK Algorithm API and AppEngine 2.5 or higher is necessary.
For example InspectorP or SIM4000 with latest firmware. Alternatively the
Emulator on AppStudio 2.3 or higher can be used.
